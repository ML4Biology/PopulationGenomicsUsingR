# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pkg_R = c("bookdown", "corrplot", "caret", "rrBLUP")
install.packages(pkg_R)

```

```{r}
lapply(pkg_R, require, character.only = TRUE)
```
